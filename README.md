## Introduction
Using binary search we go through a list with a specific target to look for or insert it where it would be in a sorted order.

Binary search is an algorithm with O(log n) time complexity, therefore the execution speed is considerably faster.

A built-in module ```time``` was used for its ```time.pref_counter``` function, to show execution speed of the code.
